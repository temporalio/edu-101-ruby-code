# Greeting Example
This example shows a basic Ruby class named `GreetSomeone`.
It takes a string, representing a person's name, as input. 
It returns a greeting that includes this name as output.

The example also includes a file `starter.rb` that will invoke this function, using a name supplied as a command-line argument. 
For example, you may run this program by passing the name "Donna" to the program:

```
$ ruby starter.rb Donna
```

This will output the greeting:

```
Hello Donna!
```

Although this example is not a Temporal Workflow, you will use this code to create a Temporal Workflow during the first exercise in this course.
